My code is very simple to run, just make sure you have numpy, matplotlib, and tqdm installed. 

You can edit the number_of_samples and number_of_cores fields depending on your computer specs. 

On my crappy laptop with six cores it took 25 seconds to run 1 billion samples.

After solving for the binomial with the maximum value it plots the distribution in matplotlib for you to look at, just something fun.
